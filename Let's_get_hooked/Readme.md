# 🔗 Let's Get Hooked! – Deep Dive into `useState` & Related Concepts

---

## 🔹 What are React Hooks?

**React Hooks** are built-in functions in React (v16.8+) that allow functional components to manage **state**, handle **side effects**, and tap into React’s lifecycle features — all **without using class components**.

### 📌 Interview Style Explanation:

> **Q: What are hooks in React? Why were they introduced?**
> **A:** Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React features like state and lifecycle from functional components. They were introduced to eliminate the need for class components and promote reuse and cleaner logic.

## 🔹 What is `useState`?

### 🔍 Definition:

`useState` is a Hook that lets you add **state variables** in functional components.

```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

* `state`: The current value.
* `setState`: A function to update that value.
* `initialValue`: Initial value of the state.

---

### ✅ Why do we need `useState`?

* Functional components **don’t have `this.state`** like class components.
* `useState` gives functional components **local memory** to store, update, and render dynamic content.

## 🧠 Behind-the-Scenes: How `useState` Works in React

* Internally, `useState` adds the state to a **fiber tree node**.
* React **preserves the order** of hooks. That’s why hooks **must not be inside conditions or loops**.
* When `setState` is called:

  1. React **creates a new fiber copy**.
  2. Triggers **reconciliation**.
  3. Compares old vs new virtual DOM.
  4. **Updates only the changed parts** of the actual DOM.

## 🔨 Practical Example: Filter Top Rated Restaurants (From Your Code)

### 🧾 Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Import useState**

```js
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

2. **Initialize State**

```js
const [restroList, setRestroList] = useState(StoreObj);
```

This means:
💭 "I want `restroList` to hold all restaurant cards initially."

3. **Filtering Logic**

```js
const FilteredObj = StoreObj.filter((res) => res.rating > 4);
setRestroList(FilteredObj);
```

This updates the state with only restaurants having a rating > 4.

4. **Rendering**

```js
{restroList.map((res, index) => (
  <RestroCard key={index} {...res} />
))}
```

## 🔁 Reusability Example

### 👨‍🍳 A small hands-on idea:

Build a **"Sort by Category"** dropdown alongside your filter button and use `setRestroList` to dynamically sort or group data.

## 🔥 Bonus Interview Concepts from Your Code

### 📌 `key={index}`

React uses **keys** to identify which items have changed. Using `index` is fine for static lists but **can cause bugs** in dynamic lists.

### 📌 JSX Comments

```jsx
{/* This is a JSX comment */}
```

## 🧪 Mini Interview Q\&A

> ❓ **What is `useState` used for?**
> ✅ It is a Hook that allows you to store and manage local state in functional components.

> ❓ **How does state change trigger a UI update in React?**
> ✅ Calling `setState` triggers React’s reconciliation process, which calculates differences and updates only the required parts of the DOM.

> ❓ **Is useState synchronous or asynchronous?**
> ✅ Asynchronous. The state update doesn’t happen immediately. React schedules a re-render.

| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useState`              | A hook to add state to functional components                                 |
| `setState`              | Updates the state and triggers a re-render                                   |
| Must not be conditional | Hooks must always run in the same order                                      |
| Behind the scenes       | Updates Fiber tree → triggers diff algo → virtual DOM → efficient DOM update |
| JSX comment             | `{/* comment */}`                                                            |

### 📘 Flashcard Example:

> 🧠 **Q:** Can I write `useState` inside a loop?
> ❌ No, hooks must be called at the top level to maintain order.

> 🧠 **Q:** Does `useState` change the DOM immediately?
> ❌ No, React batches updates and triggers reconciliation first.
